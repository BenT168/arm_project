\section{I. Work Splitting between team members}


The first meeting was hold after the introduction lecture of the project last 
Thursday. The discussion was started with the analysis of the project 
specification. We started splitting the work when every team member had some 
basic understanding on how the project works. Before working on the project, 
each of us had done some reading on the C programming.  We decided to have a 
header file for all the bit manipulation functions planned to focus 
on the implementation of first part before moving on to the second part.\\
\\
The tasks for Part 1 was being split as below:\\
Ben Sheng Tan	\\
 - structure and function for data processing instruction \\
 - function for decoding the instruction from pipeline \\
 - header and part of the implementation files for bitwise \\
 - header and implementation files for register \\
 - modification of MakeFile \\
Adanna Akwataghibe\\
 - the emulator binary file loader and the main method \\
 - the multiply instruction in emulator and its helper methods\\
 - part of the structures of ARM\\
Lan Yi	\\
 - structure and function for single data transfer instruction\\
 - function for printing bits in implementation file for bitwise\\
 - part of the structures of ARM\\
Ching Yin Wong\\
 - structure and function for branch instruction\\
 - function for getting bits in implementation file for bitwise\\
 - function for checking condition function in emulator.c\\
 - emulator function in emulator.c\\
\\
The tasks of debugging and refining code were done by Ben Sheng Tan and Ching 
Yin Wong while the implementation of the binary file writer and the abstract 
data structure for assembler were carried out by Adanna and Lan Yi at the same 
stage.\\

\section{II. Structure for Emulator}

For part 1 , we have broken into several sections in emulate.c and several 
files in library, as listed below:\\
\\src \\
\\emulate.c\\
 - MACRO -> contains functions for 8 bits and 32 bits in reading and writing 
from/to memory and the inclusive header files for register, which contains 
the info about REGISTER READ/WRITE  \\
 - FUNCTION PROTOTYPE -> contains code lines with the function name, parameters
 and the result it returns\\
 - BINARY FILE LOADER -> contains the function to read binary file reader or 
otherwise, read the arm program \\
 - CORE -> contains, mainly, the pipeline simulation function - a series of 
functions for easier flag operations - an instruction decoder which 
identifies the instruction type based on the specified bits - a function that 
checks the 4-bit conditions at the beginning - a function to print the arm 
state\\
 - INSTRUCTIONS -> contains 4 functions for executing each type of instruction\\
 - MAIN -> contains main function for running the file \\
\\
src/library\\
 \\arm11.h \\
Pipeline, state of arm, register definition and flag definition
 \\instruction.h \\	
Structure of the instructions, type of shift and definition of mnemonic
\\bitwise.h and bitwise.c	\\
 - declare the functions written in implementation file and define some 
essential methods for bit (header file) \\
 - functions for printing bits, getting bits, rotating left and right 
(implementation file) \\
\\register.h and register.c\\
 - declare the functions written in implementation file, define the register 
write and register read and the structure of CPSR flag (header file)\\
 - shifting functions for immediate register and shift register (implementation
 file)\\
 
\section{III. Group Dynamics}

The group has worked very well so far with strong communication with each other
. Although we had a few bumps on our different programming styles, we had 
refined and restructured the codes when we merged our works for part 1. As most
 of the group members are unfamiliar with git, we spent a day on git to get 
used to the environment working using git. \\\\
Below are some of the problems we faced and solutions we found when carrying 
out our project:\\\\
 Problems\\	
 - using pointers correctly \\
 - allocating memory correctly (when using malloc and calloc)\\
 - dealing with merge conflicts \\
 - dealing with segmentation fault \\\\
 Solutions\\	
 - practice coding using pointers\\
 - the dynamic memory allocation and remembering to free memory afterwards\\ 
 - telling team members when pushing of pulling from git \\
 - using valgrind to check for leaks is extremely useful.\\

\section{IV. Future Task Collaboration}

For Part two (assembler), task allocation was done among all the team 
members. As all the group members are unfamiliar with coding in C, we will 
practice more to get used to the concept of pointers and structure. The real 
challenge will be the multiples coding styles in C programming, therefore, we 
will ensure that the similar style is applied to prevent any confusion.\\\\
 
Below are some of the precautions we will beware of:\\\\
 
Precautions\\	
 - merge conflict can be a pain and could take a long time to sort out, so 
communication with team is  very important to prevent this\\
 - allocate memory correctly to avoid segmentation fault \\\\
